# TaskFlow 
A TaskFlow is a simple yet powerful application that allows users to organize tasks by adding, editing, marking as complete, and deleting them. Below is a brief description of how a To-Do list can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

## Features
- Users can add new tasks to the list.
- Tasks can be marked as completed or uncompleted.
- Users can delete tasks when they are no longer needed.
- Optionally, tasks can be edited for corrections or updates.
- Allow users to toggle between light and dark modes.
